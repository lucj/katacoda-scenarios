In this step you will start k0s in the single-node configuration.

Create a single node k0s cluster:

`sudo k0s install controller --single`{{execute}}

You should get an output similar to the following one:

```
INFO[2021-06-24 18:36:26] no config file given, using defaults         
INFO[2021-06-24 18:36:26] creating user: etcd                          
INFO[2021-06-24 18:36:26] creating user: kube-apiserver                
INFO[2021-06-24 18:36:26] creating user: konnectivity-server           
INFO[2021-06-24 18:36:26] creating user: kube-scheduler                
INFO[2021-06-24 18:36:26] Installing k0s service
```

ðŸ”¥ A configuration file could be provided using the *-c* flag should you want to use other properties than the default ones.

This output shows that k0s systemd service is created (but is not started yet).

You can get additional information using systemctl:

`sudo systemctl status k0scontroller`{{execute}}

Start the cluster:

`sudo k0s start`{{execute}}

Next verify it has been started properly:

`sudo k0s status`{{execute}}

You should should get an output similar the following one:

```
Version: v1.21.2+k0s.0
Process ID: 1672
Parent Process ID: 1
Role: controller+worker
Init System: linux-systemd
Service file: /etc/systemd/system/k0scontroller.service
```

As k0s comes with its own kubectl subcommand, you can directly list the status of our single node cluster:

`sudo k0s kubectl get node`{{execute}}

:fire: it takes a few tens of seconds for the cluster to be up and running, for a few tens of seconds you might get the following output:

```
No resources found
```

When the cluster is up and running you should get an output similar to the following one (the name of your node will be different though):

```
NAME              STATUS   ROLES    AGE     VERSION
ip-172-31-17-54   Ready    <none>   5m45s   v1.21.2+k0s
```
